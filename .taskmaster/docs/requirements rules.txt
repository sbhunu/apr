  To ensure the best practices are tailored to your project, please adapt the globs according to your specific needs. Below are the best practices for each major library/framework identified in your dependencies.

---

name: nextjs-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for Next.js applications and routing  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}  
---  

- Use the App Router for better performance and improved data fetching.
- Implement proper error boundaries to handle errors gracefully.
- Optimize images and static assets for faster load times.
- Utilize API routes for server-side logic and data fetching.

---

name: typescript-best-practices.mdc  
description: TypeScript coding standards and type safety guidelines  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}  
---  

- Use strict null checks to avoid runtime errors.
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes.
- Implement type guards to ensure type safety in conditional logic.
- Use generics to create reusable and type-safe components.

---

name: supabase-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for using Supabase as a backend  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}  
---  

- Use Row-Level Security (RLS) to enforce data access policies.
- Structure your database schema to minimize redundancy and optimize queries.
- Utilize Supabase's real-time capabilities for live updates in your application.
- Regularly back up your database and test recovery procedures.

---

name: postgis-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for spatial data management with PostGIS  
globs: **/*.{sql}  
---  

- Use spatial indexes (GIST) on geometry columns for faster queries.
- Validate geometries using PostGIS functions (e.g., ST_IsValid) before storing.
- Regularly analyze and vacuum your spatial tables to maintain performance.
- Use appropriate SRIDs for your spatial data to ensure accuracy in calculations.

---

name: react-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for React component development  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}  
---  

- Use functional components and hooks for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Implement memoization (React.memo, useMemo) to optimize performance.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type-checking props.

---

name: tailwindcss-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for styling with Tailwind CSS  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,css}  
---  

- Use utility-first classes to build responsive designs without custom CSS.
- Leverage Tailwind's JIT mode for faster build times and on-demand class generation.
- Organize your Tailwind configuration for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Use variants (hover, focus) to enhance interactivity and accessibility.

---

name: jest-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for testing with Jest  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}  
---  

- Write unit tests for all components and utility functions.
- Use snapshot testing for components to catch unexpected changes.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate tests and improve performance.
- Organize tests alongside components for better maintainability.

---

name: react-query-best-practices.mdc  
description: Best practices for data fetching with React Query  
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}  
---  

- Use query keys to uniquely identify queries and manage cache effectively.
- Implement background refetching to keep data fresh without user intervention.
- Use mutation hooks for creating, updating, and deleting data with optimistic updates.
- Leverage the devtools for debugging and monitoring query states.
