 You need to adapt the globs depending on the project. Here are the best practices for each major library/framework found in your dependencies:

---
name: nextjs-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for Next.js applications and routing
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}
---

- Use the App Router for better performance and organization of routes.
- Implement proper error boundaries to handle errors gracefully.
- Utilize Next.js's built-in image optimization features for faster loading times.
- Prefer static generation (SSG) over server-side rendering (SSR) when possible for improved performance.

---
name: react-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for React development
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---

- Use functional components and hooks for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Implement memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) to optimize performance.
- Manage state effectively using Context API or state management libraries like Redux.
- Ensure components are reusable and follow the single responsibility principle.

---
name: tailwindcss-best-practices.mdc
description: Guidelines for using Tailwind CSS in projects
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,css}
---

- Use utility-first classes to build components quickly and efficiently.
- Create custom themes and extend Tailwind's configuration for consistent styling.
- Utilize responsive design features to ensure your UI works on all devices.
- Avoid using arbitrary values in class names; prefer using Tailwind's spacing and sizing scale.

---
name: typescript-best-practices.mdc 
description: TypeScript coding standards and type safety guidelines
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}
---

- Use strict null checks to avoid runtime errors and improve type safety.
- Prefer interface over type for defining object shapes and contracts.
- Use type guards and assertions to ensure type safety in complex scenarios.
- Implement proper type inference to reduce redundancy and improve code clarity.

---
name: eslint-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for ESLint configuration and usage
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---

- Use the recommended ESLint configuration for Next.js to ensure best practices.
- Regularly run linting as part of your development workflow to catch issues early.
- Customize rules to fit your team's coding standards while maintaining consistency.
- Integrate ESLint with your editor for real-time feedback on code quality.
