- Use spatial indexes (GIST) on geometry columns for faster queries.
- Validate geometries using PostGIS functions (e.g., ST_IsValid) before storing.
- Regularly analyze and vacuum your spatial tables to maintain performance.
- Use appropriate SRIDs for your spatial data to ensure accuracy in calculations.
