- Use utility-first classes to build components quickly and efficiently.
- Create custom themes and extend Tailwind's configuration for consistent styling.
- Utilize responsive design features to ensure your UI works on all devices.
- Avoid using arbitrary values in class names; prefer using Tailwind's spacing and sizing scale.
